A project started for my Control Systems class. Will be designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico. It will utilize an IR sensor to detect the presence of a vehicle in the garage and indicate with an LED, then an ultrasonic sensor to get an analog measurement to warn the vehicle when to slow down and stop, using 3 other LEDs.
